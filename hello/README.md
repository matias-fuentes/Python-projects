[Hello](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2020/fall/psets/6/hello/#hello)
========================================================================

Implement a program that prints out a simple greeting to the user, per the below.

```
$ python hello.py
What is your name?
David
hello, David
```

## Specification

Write, in a file called `hello.py` in `~/pset6/hello`, a program that prompts a user for their name, and then prints `hello, so-and-so`, where `so-and-so` is their provided name, exactly as you did in [Problem Set 1](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2020/fall/psets/1/), except that your program this time should be written in Python.

## Usage

Your program should behave per the example below.

```
$ python hello.py
What is your name?
Emma
hello, Emma
```

## Testing

While `check50` is available for this problem, you're encouraged to first test your code on your own for each of the following.

-   Run your program as `python hello.py`, and wait for a prompt for input. Type in `David` and press enter. Your program should output `hello, David`.
-   Run your program as `python hello.py`, and wait for a prompt for input. Type in `Brian` and press enter. Your program should output `hello, Brian`.

Execute the below to evaluate the correctness of your code using `check50`. But be sure to compile and test it yourself as well!

```
check50 cs50/problems/2020/fall/sentimental/hello
```

Execute the below to evaluate the style of your code using `style50`.

```
style50 hello.py
```

This problem will be graded only along the axes of correctness and style.

## How to Submit

1.  Download your `hello.py` file by control-clicking or right-clicking on the file in CS50 IDE's file browser and choosing Download.
2.  Go to CS50's [Gradescope page](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/157004).

4.  Drag and drop your `hello.py` file to the area that says "Drag & Drop". Be sure it has the correct filename!
5.  Click "Upload".

You should see a message that says "Problem Set 6: Sentimental (Hello) submitted successfully!" You won't see a score just yet, but if you see the message then we've received your submission!
